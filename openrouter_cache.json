Since I don't know your story's genre, setting, or existing characters, I'll provide a few options with different vibes. Choose the one that fits best, or mix and match elements!\n\n**Option 1: The Jaded Archivist (Fantasy/Historical/Mystery)**\n\n*   **Name:** Master Elias Thorne (or Elara Thorne)\n*   **Concept:** The head (or perhaps the sole remaining member) of a forgotten archive, library, or museum dedicated to a specific, obscure field (e.g., failed prophecies, pre-cataclysm history, magical anomalies, lost cartography). They've seen countless theories rise and fall and are deeply cynical about grand claims or heroic quests.\n*   **Personality:** Dry-witted, sarcastic, meticulously organized (bordering on obsessive), extremely knowledgeable within their niche but dismissive of anything outside it. Secretly harbors a deep-seated loneliness or a past trauma related to the knowledge they guard. Doesn't suffer fools gladly.\n*   **Appearance:** Prefers practical, perhaps slightly dated clothing. Often seen with spectacles perched on their nose, ink stains on their fingers, or dust on their shoulders. Moves with quiet efficiency.\n*   **Skills:*\n...\n\nUser: What is our story about?": "Based on the provided codex entries, here's a summary of your story:\n\nYour story is a horror/mystery tale centered around a young girl named Lily who moves with her family to a house (the Old Cottage) near a dangerous location, the Midnight Pond. This pond is home to Freddy Frog, a malevolent entity disguised as a friendly frog who targets children. Freddy is responsible for multiple disappearances and can transform into a monstrous form. The pond itself is located within the Whispering Woods, a mysterious forest with eerie whispers and a dark reputation. Lily narrowly escapes becoming a victim of Freddy, possibly with the help of the Ghost Children â€“ the spirits of Freddy's past victims who try to warn others. Lily's encounter with Freddy may have left her with strange side effects, such as a taste for catching flies.\n\nIn essence, it's a story about a child encountering a supernatural predator in a cursed location and the potential lasting effects of that encounter.",

    "google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25::Can you see any codex entries yet?": "That's an interesting question! It depends on what you mean by \"codex entries.\"\n\nAs an AI, I don't \"see\" things visually like a human does. I process information based on the vast dataset I was trained on. So:\n\n1.  **If you mean entries from a specific game's codex (like Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Warframe, etc.):** I don't have real-time access to any specific game's internal database or *your* personal progress in a game. However, my training data includes a massive amount of text from the internet, which likely contains information *about* the lore, characters, places, and events described in many popular game codices. So, I can often *discuss* the content found in those entries or even generate text *similar* to a codex entry if you give me a topic.\n2.  **If you mean historical codices (like the Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Vaticanus, Maya codices, etc.):** Yes, my training data includes information about many historical texts, including famous codices. I can tell you about their history, content, and significance.\n3.  **If you mean the OpenAI Codex model:** That was a specific AI model focused on code generation, a predecessor to some of the technology used in models like me. I am a large language model, not specifically the \"Codex\" model itself, although I have strong coding capabilities derived from similar research.\n\n**To give you the best answer, could you clarify what kind of \"codex entries\" you're asking about?** For example, are you thinking of a particular game or topic?",
